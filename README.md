# Vulkan Tutorial 2

This is my second attempt to follow the [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).
This time I am doing it on a GNU/Linux environment.

Same as before, my code differs from the official solution in that I am splitting the code into several source files.

I also have a different folder for each of the tutorialâ€™s sections:

## VulkanTest
[VkTest](VulkanTest) is for the first section: [Development environment](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment).

## VkTriangle
[VkTriangle](VkTriangle) for the second section: [Drawing a Triangle](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Setup).
